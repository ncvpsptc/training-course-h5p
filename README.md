# Interactive Training Books
## About
This repository stores the collection of interactive training books used in the Peer Tutoring Center's Internal Training Course.

## Development
In addition to Git, editing course books require the use of the [Lumi Education Desktop App](https://www.lumi.education/#download) to open the `.h5p` files. After changes are completed, create a pull request with a name and description of the changes made from your development branch and merge. Changes will automatically be applied to Canvas pages .
